## Short Interactive Story

A short text-based interactive story written in **Python**.

An exercise in learning functional programming. Generally, each function block represents a "scene", and features only a handful of situations and variants.
Each one generally either triggers another function (step in the story) or asks you to make a decision, which is then assigned to a variable that gets "fed" as argument/parameter to another function.

I originally planned this to be a fully-functional text-adventure along the lines of the old ["Zork"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork).

## How to use

The game is playable from the command line, but you will need to have Python installed: [python.org](https://www.python.org/)
