## Python text-based adventure

As per title, a short text-based interactive story written in **Python**.
Originally one of my project submissions for the "_Introduction to Programming_" nanodegree with [Udacity](www.udacity.com).

Work in progress that should evolve along with my programming skills. It's currently built purely on functions and `if/else` statements, each one representing a "scene", and features only a handful of situations and variants. 

I plan to expand this to be a fully-functional text-adventure along the lines of the old ["Zork"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork).


### Current to-do:

- [ ] Add descriptive comments to code
- [ ] Decrease repetition by replacing function combo `print('')`/`time.sleep()` **with a dedicated function**
- [ ] Give player choice to pick up Platypus effigy
- [ ] Add at least two more monsters to the story ("Hollowman","Mouldwoman") with personalised descriptions and situations
- [ ] `time.sleep()` **values are inaccurate: add a function that calculates value based on number of characters and/or word length**
